# vue-template

template is written by handlebars inside template folder.

Running vue-router-cli will check `src/views` folder and add router-link in App.vue, add route config in router.js as well.

Refer `vue-route-generator`

```bash
npm link dvr # install dvr into node_modules locally
dvr init <projectName> # download this project
dvr refresh # generate route
```
